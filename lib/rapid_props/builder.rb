module RapidProps
  # Provides syntatic sugar for defining all the property implementations in this gem.
  # An instance of this class is passed to the code defining properties.
  #
  # To support only a subset of property types offered by this library:
  #
  #   class MyBuilder
  #     include RapidProps::BuilderSupport
  #
  #     # only the ones you want
  #     include RapidProps::DateProperty::Builder
  #   end
  #
  # To add support for new property types while retaining all the existing properties defined
  # by this gem:
  #
  #   class MyBuilder < RapidProps::Builder
  #     include MyPropertyType::Builder
  #   end
  class Builder
